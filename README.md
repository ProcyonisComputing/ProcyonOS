### ProcyonOS 1 'Amiable Armadillo'
We've begun the development of ProcyonOS 1 "Amiable Armadillo." This is the first version of ProcyonOS, which, as stated on our old website, was born from the ashes of DonutOS, originally developed by Gautham Nair.

With ProcyonOS, development is no longer just under Gautham Nair. It is now a collective effort by the emerging open-source community of Procyonis Computing. Procyonis Computing is a non-profit, community-supported organization with a single goal: to create stylish, free, and reliable open-source software products, primarily based on the GNU/Linux platform.

Like its predecessor, DonutOS, ProcyonOS is being developed using the Linux From Scratch (LFS) guidelines. However, the effort is no longer limited to Gautham Nair; it is now open to anyone with an interest in ProcyonOS, Procyonis Computing, Linux, or the open-source software community in general.

ProcyonOS is projected to feature a modern, easy-to-use UI, a built-in local* AI model, and more.

This version of ProcyonOS will include ProcyonPac, a package manager currently under development. ProcyonPac will fetch software and updates from the ProcyonHub repository on GitHub.

Since the package manager is still in its early stages and doesn't yet have the capabilities of mature and trusted options like apt or dnf, we recommend that users of ProcyonOS 1 manually download, compile, and install software themselves using tools like wget and make.
